# Open-Source-Project-Application
Application Questions for the Matplotlib Hatching Project  
All activities should be performed on [my fork](https://github.com/Impaler343/matplotlib) and not on the official repository of Matplotlib.
You can fork my fork to submit PRs for your tasks

# Getting Started
Set up the Development Environment of Matplotlib by using this [link](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/development_setup.html)  
I would recommend using a conda environment and installing all optional dependencies before setting up Matplotlib in editable mode  
Also, don't forget to install the pre-commit hooks as well!

# Submit your first PR!

# Create the Vertical, Horizblahabla

# Solve any Good First Issue 

# Write a Proposal for the project
